This patch set is for the now obsolete version ASxxxx Assembler 5.06.
You are advised to instead use the latest ASxxxx Assembler and
corresponding patches instead.

This is being provided here only for completeness, as this disassembler
at one time targeted this old version.  You can still get that version
from the ASxxxx archives from here:
https://shop-pdp.net/ashtml/asxarc.php
or more directly:
https://shop-pdp.net/_ftp/asxxxx/

This patch to the assembler is required to guarantee roundtrip of
the disassembled code back into the original binary image.


avxv5pxx_6811_no_opt.patch:

The avxv5pxx_6811_no_opt.patch patch file was created to remove the
direct addressing mode optimization in the 6811 Assembler, as
described in the M6811 Code-Seeking Disassembler documentation.

To apply, unzip the av5p06.zip file: 

On Linux and Mac, use:
unzip -L -a av5p06.zip
From the folder you unzip to, run:
patch -p1 < avxv5pxx_6811_no_opt.patch

On Windows, use:
unzip av5p06.zip
From the folder you unzip to, run:
patch -p1 < avxv5pxx_6811_no_opt_windows.patch


And then recompile the as6811 assembler (following its instructions).

This will update the AS6811 assembler to not optimize addresses
in the 0x0000-0x00FF range to Direct (S_DIR) Addressing Mode
unless they are preceded by the "*" symbol and instead keep them
as Extended (S_EXT) Addressing Mode.

This is needed to make sure that code generated by this M6811DIS
program, when reassembled with the AS6811 assembler, will produce
the same original binary that was disassembled.
